 Smooth Student Submission System (SSSS)

 The first version was developed by
 Gjalt-Jorn Peters for the Dutch Open University
 in September 2012.
----------------------------------------------------

This system was developed to provide a simple
interface for students to submit papers. The papers
are then sent to their supervisor. If students
indicate that they didn't have a supervisor yet,
the system chooses one randomly, based on each
teacher's capacity.
